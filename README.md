# GEOG 458 Lab 3 – COVID-19 Web Maps

This project presents two interactive web maps visualizing COVID-19 data in the United States (2020) using Mapbox GL JS.

## Map 1: Choropleth Map (COVID-19 Rates)
This map shows county-level COVID-19 case rates (cases per 1,000 residents) using a choropleth representation with an Albers projection.

## Map 2: Proportional Symbol Map (COVID-19 Cases)
This map displays total COVID-19 cases by county using proportional circle symbols. Larger and darker circles indicate higher case counts.
